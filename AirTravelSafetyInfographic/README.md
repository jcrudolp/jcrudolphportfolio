Air Travel Safety Infographic

For this infographic, I designed a scrollable format optimized for mobile viewing, aiming to present information clearly and engagingly to audiences. By including automobile safety statistics for comparison, I highlighted the significantly lower fatality rates of air travel, helping the audience understand the safety of occasional flights versus daily driving. This was made as an additional element to the Executive Summary Presentation but was geared towards the general public audience rather than internal employees.
