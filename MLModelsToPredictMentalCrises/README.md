 Case Study: Using Machine Learning Models to Predict Mental Health Crises 

This case study explores a machine learning model developed by Garriga et al. to predict mental health crises from electronic health records, aimed at improving patient outcomes amid rising mental healthcare demands. By analyzing data from over 17,000 patients, the study utilized features like patient demographics and previous crisis events to generate a predicted risk score using the XGBoost algorithm, which significantly outperformed other methods. Results indicated varying effectiveness based on disorder type, with the model achieving an overall AUROC of 0.797 and showing promise in clinical settings, where predictions were deemed useful in 64% of cases. The findings suggest that further research could enhance the model's accuracy and fairness across diverse patient populations.
