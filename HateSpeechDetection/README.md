## Automated Models to Detect Hate Speech on Social Media

This project focused on developing machine learning models for sentiment analysis and hate speech detection on Twitter. By utilizing a specialized dataset, it aimed to categorize tweets as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, enhancing content moderation systems and fostering safer online environments. The project evaluated various algorithms, with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and XGBoost emerging as the most effective models for accurately detecting hate speech in real-time.
