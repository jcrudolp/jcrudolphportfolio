This project addresses the challenge of low student engagement in university education by analyzing how physiological responses correlate with engagement levels, aiming to provide actionable insights for educators. Using a simulated dataset from Kaggle, which includes physiological and behavioral data, the project explores key indicators such as heart rate, cortisol levels, and self-reported engagement. The analysis revealed significant patterns, with disengaged students showing higher heart rates and cortisol levels, while engaged students exhibited lower levels of both, aligning with positive emotional states. The Random Forest Classifier demonstrated excellent predictive accuracy, suggesting that real-time monitoring of physiological responses could effectively inform teaching strategies and enhance student learning outcomes.
