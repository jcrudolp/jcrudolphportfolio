## Tableau Exploration of Sales Data 

In this assignment, I created several visualizations in Tableau to analyze sales and profitability data. A side-by-side bar chart compared the total price of items sold against their profit, revealing that while beer and popcorn had equal sales, popcorn was significantly more profitable. A highlight table ranked items by total profit, showcasing popcorn as the top performer, with beer trailing at 62.5% of its profit. I also used horizontal bars to display average calories by category, indicating that hot food had the highest average calories, while beverages were the lowest. Finally, a treemap illustrated the most popular selling items, identifying beer as the top seller and ice cream sandwiches as the least, despite pizzaâ€™s high sales rank despite low profitability. Consistent gradient color schemes were employed throughout for clarity and cohesion.
