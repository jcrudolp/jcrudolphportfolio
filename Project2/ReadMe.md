Cardiovascular Risk Forecasting: Leveraging Health Data to Improve Patient Outcomes 

This project focuses on developing a predictive model to identify individuals at high risk of heart attacks, aiming to improve patient outcomes in the face of rising heart disease prevalence. Utilizing the "Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset," the model analyzes various physiological factors such as age, cholesterol, and exercise-induced angina to determine their relationship with heart attack occurrences. After evaluating multiple machine learning models, the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and L2 regularized Logistic Regression emerged as the most effective, demonstrating high accuracy and precision. The findings emphasize the importance of early detection and targeted interventions to enhance heart health and reduce healthcare burdens.
