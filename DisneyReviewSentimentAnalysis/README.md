## The Merits of Various Sentiment Models in Interpreting Disneyland Reviews 

This project investigates the effectiveness of various sentiment analysis models in evaluating reviews from Disneyland resorts in California, Paris, and Hong Kong. By utilizing a dataset from Kaggle, I applied sentiment analysis techniques, specifically NLTK VADER and regression models, to analyze and predict sentiments expressed in guest reviews. The findings revealed that the Random Forest Classifier outperformed the Decision Tree Classifier, particularly when using VADER sentiment polarity scores, highlighting the importance of accurately interpreting guest feedback. Ultimately, this analysis aims to provide actionable insights for Disneyland stakeholders to enhance guest experiences and address areas of improvement effectively.
